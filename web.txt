How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? 

The internet is a one big, giant network that is made up of a lot of smaller networks used to pass around data with one another. The internet use to need wires to connect to landlines but because technology has advanced so there are wireless routers now.  All websites have an IP address (a unique address to find that computer on the network), but because the human brain isnt made to remember a lot of number sequences, websites have a hostname(hostnames are nicknames for the server) which is easier for the human brain to remember. For example, it is easier to remember a hostname (like google.com) over 561.32.15.665. 

If you are in an internet browser, and click on a link what happens is the hidden information associated with the URL (Uniform resource locator) indicates the next web page that you want to view. Inside of the URL is the name of the web site that holds the page that youâ€™ve asked for.  Your browser takes that URL, breaks out the name of the web site, and then uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to get an IP address for the site. Your browser then opens a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the web site over IP.  It asks to speak to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server (HTTPS, for secure connections) which then provides the next web page in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) that your browser renders.
