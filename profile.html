    <h1>Hi, Im Sherena.</h1>
    <p>
      Somethings about me, I use to be in the fashion industry. I was an apparel
      technical designer, I have experience with fashion design and graphic
      design as well. But at the end of my fashion career I was a technical
      designer because I enjoyed it more and it was more straight forward than
      design(and I was tired of the sleepless nights).
    </p>
    <p>
      For fun I enjoy crafting or doing puzzles. My favorite shows are Friends,
      The Office, and How I Met Your Mother. My favorite artist are Taylor Swift
      and Lifehouse

      <li>craft/sew</li>
      <li>some wedding planning</li>
      <li>and sometimes absolutely nothing</li>
